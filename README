# PETRICIDE

## Inspiration
We liked the idea of organic growth in games like space invaders and wanted to create a programme that used this kind of basis. The idea for a game based around viruses and bacteria also stemmed from the organic feel.

## What it does
Petricide is a online, multiplayer realtime game where you play as a virus fighting for survival. 5 players can play at one time and each is assigned a colour territory. The idea is that the user defends their own territory against other players whilst expanding and dominating the petri dish arena.

## Challenges we ran into
Everything. Especially the fact Napolita pizza wouldn’t deliver on a Saturday night.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We built a meteor programme in 12 hours (11 if you don’t include the pizza break.) A fully functional 8 bit style game.

## What we’ve learned
That multiplayer synchronisty is very very difficult with huge data structures.

## What’s next for Petricide
Different rooms for more players, teams with shared click actions and spawn actions, leaderboards where score is based on combined cell strength
