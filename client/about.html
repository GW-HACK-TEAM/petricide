  <h1>About</h1>
  <h2>Inspiration</h2>
  <p>We liked the idea of organic growth in games like space invaders and wanted to create a programme that used this kind of basis. The idea for a game based around viruses and bacteria also stemmed from the organic feel.</p>

  <h2>What it does</h2>
  <p>Petricide is a online, multiplayer realtime game where you play as a virus fighting for survival. 5 players can play at one time and each is assigned a colour territory. The idea is that the user defends their own territory against other players whilst expanding and dominating the petri dish arena.</p>

  <h2>Challenges we ran into</h2>
  <p>Everything. Especially the fact Napolita pizza wouldn’t deliver on a Saturday night.</p>

  <h2>Accomplishments that we’re proud of</h2>
  <p>We built a meteor programme in 12 hours (11 if you don’t include the pizza break.) A fully functional 8 bit style game.</p>

  <h2>What we’ve learned</h2>
  <p>That multiplayer synchronisty is very very difficult with huge data structures.</p>

  <h2>What’s next for Petricide</h2>
  <p>Different rooms for more players, teams with shared click actions and spawn actions, leaderboards where score is based on combined cell strength</p>
